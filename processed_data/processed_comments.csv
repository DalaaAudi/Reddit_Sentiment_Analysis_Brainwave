1kneerk,msiagu8,"Elementary Admin here.

I asked our tech department to conduct an AI training for my staff, mostly so we understood the ethical/legal concerns of using it in education.

They showed my teachers how to create pre assessments, student-specific interesting reading passages, etc. Some pretty cool stuff you can’t easily replicate or buy from someone at a reasonable price.

Afterwards, I stood up and reminded the staff about the importance of the “human factor” of what we do and ensuring that we never let these tools replace the love and care we bring to our jobs.

I had a teacher raise their hand and ask why we weren’t allowing them to use ChatGPT to write emails to parents about their child’s behavior/academics, or to write their report card comments.

Everyone agreed it was ridiculous to remove from them such an impressive tool when it came to communicating with families.

I waited a bit, and then said, “How would you feel if I used ChatGPT to write your yearly evaluations?”

They all thought that was not okay totally different from what they wanted to do.

In education, it’s always okay for a teacher to do it, because their job is so hard (it is, but…); but, no one else is ever under as much stress and deserving of the same allowance.

Edit: guys, guys…it’s the hypocrisy. Not whether or not AI is useful.

I use ChatGPT all the time in my job. For example: I needed to create a new dress code, but I hated that it was full of “No” and “Don’t.” So, I fed ChatGPT my dress code and asked it to created positive statements of those rules.

That saved me time, and didn’t steal from someone genuine, heartfelt feedback.",1747339571.0,1736,2025-05-15 20:06:11

This is *absolutely* a valid use-case for AI tools. Generate the written notes, then the prof reads over them and tunes them with their expertise. And to say ""well, what am I paying for if the prof is using AI to generate the notes?"" Expertise. You're paying for them to make sure the stuff generated is hallucinated bullshit. You're paying for someone to help guide you when something isn't clear. You're paying for an expert to walk you down the right path of learning, rather than spitting random facts at you.

One professor has asked us to use it to grade ourselves before submitting papers. That’s been a game changer. 

The original guideline was to allow up to 30% AI. However, it’s pretty easy to ask AI to not sound AI. 

The papers in which we have written have been focused on our data sets and our situations. So it’s obvious when someone BSed their paper. 

We’ve been approved to use AI to improve our original essay. If we choose to do so, our original must be submitted too. Then we must discuss our paper with our professor. 

Honestly, it’s helped me “think tank” better ways to convey what I really want to say… more professionally.

1kneerk,msj801y,"My take as an ex professor:

Look. Professors shouldn’t do this. But young professors put years and years of effort into getting their degree and then get paid ridiculously low wages.  They not only have to prepare, teach, grade, and meet with students, they also have to justify their existence by publishing and/or getting grants. And they have to do hours of stupid committee work. 

On top of that they are at the mercy of their dean and, worse, their department members to keep their job. Imagine if your co-workers had power over you getting to keep your job. If you don’t go to the right parties, if you are better liked by students, if you have different (more modern) ideas? You can be denied tenure.

And students. Some of them are great. Most are average human beings. But some are such a pain in the ass. Not the immature ones. . .that’s understandable. But you get students who don’t do any of the work and then come tell you at the end of the semester that you HAVE to pass them and act threatening. That isn’t uncommon. You get bad reviews because you do your job and require students to do things. And then there are the unwell students. If you are a caring person, what do you do with the students who are mentally ill, suicidal, who say they were raped, who say things that make you wonder if they are psychopaths, the ones who develop a crush on you and make things weird?

Academia is a hot mess. And almost nobody goes into it wanting anything more than to share something they are passionate about with others. Then reality hits and they discover the job isn’t about that much at all. I can understand professors cutting corners.

1kneerk,msjsxrl,"On AIs increasing use in colleges and universities. I do wonder if this is going to actually present an amazing opportunity for students who recognise it for what it is over the next few years. What a trap AI is.

I know from working with adults going back into full time education, that the prevalence of AI doing all the work for students is now insane. Of the adults I help go back to higher education, they all tell me most of the people in their class have AI answer all their questions for assignments and they just go in and try edit it down to look human.

I also know that the colleges (who I speak to) have seen huge grade inflation on assignments, with almost everyone now getting really good passing grades in all assignments. But that the exam parts of the studies have a huge failing rate.

Basically, the students aren’t learning or understanding the material being taught anymore because AI is doing it for them.

I wonder if this is actually beneficial for students who ignore AIs temptation and focus on doing things the traditional way, and actually studying. Actually learning the concepts.

When it comes to graduation and looking for opportunities, actually understanding the things you learned might massively advantage you as a student against all your classmates who had AI do everything for them. 

When the PHD program, or research programs, or whatever post doc or specialist industry roles are doing their interviews for limited positions, every single one of you who is a traditional student will have an advantage compared to your peers, because AI is still so new atm that the consequences of doing an entire education with AI and not actually learning yourself haven’t started happening yet.

In say 10 years time, people will have learned that the consequences of just using AI ruins any future possibilities with your eventual qualification because it will be a hollow qualification.

So now is the mini golden age as students when you can actually have 95% of your classmates, aka your competitors when you leave full time education, accidentally be making themselves utterly worthless in their chosen fields. Past generations didn’t have this, and future ones probably won’t. You are in a very rare period of time where you’ll enter the postgrad market with your cohort largely having sabotaged themselves and ruined their competitiveness with you.

Exactly — that’s a smart observation.

AI can definitely aid SDRs by automating repetitive tasks like:
	•	Identifying leads based on data patterns
	•	Drafting initial outreach emails or LinkedIn messages
	•	Logging activities into the CRM
	•	Scheduling follow-ups or meetings
	•	Providing insights on lead behavior (e.g., email opens, site visits)

But replacing SDRs entirely is much harder because the role often relies on:
	•	Real-time judgment about how to handle a conversation
	•	Emotional intelligence to build rapport and pivot tactfully
	•	Human nuance in qualifying leads and uncovering pain points
	•	The ability to adapt messaging on the fly based on tone, reaction, or industry

Professors are paid to teach and grade. And I give them a pass if ChatGPT helps them teach by finding a better way to communicate the material, but at what point do colleges get overtaken by nonPHD holding content creators and the free information that’s available and redistributed that doesn’t live in a University’s physical library.

I had the same thought when schools started connecting their libraries. That’s how old I am. I would ask myself why I would ever go to an expensive college when the resources were available to the cheaper colleges.

My best teacher was a community college guy teaching geology and he said “You could take this class online, but you didn’t- you chose me and I will give you the enhanced version.” Because yeah, we could have taken it online and copied quizlets. 

Colleges have been decreasing in value for a while now. A teacher using GPT for grading is the lowest hypocrisy. There was an unspoken contract that teachers would never give more work than they could grade. And I know some teachers who don’t know how to grade with GPT are still drowning their students with AI generated material.

The kicker is AI is generative and does not iterate. It doesn’t really understand or reason. Every request is just token vectors.

Or they realized that ""my teacher is using AI without complying to policy"" won't get the headlines that would result in the organization doing more than closing the complaint and maybe CCing the professor if they're feeling motivated. 

This complaint could easily be ""quit wasting my time and do you job"" directed at both the professor and the administration that created policies without also creating an enforcement mechanism (specifically, that relied on student reports without the transparency the students would need to make them). The sort of changes that complaint requests don't happen without substantial pressure, and an NYT interview provides that pressure whereas even an entire class complaining doesn't if the complaints stay within the system where no one else sees them. But that interview, and the article this post links, don't happen if the story isn't at least a little salacious. If you want press attention on your issue, you need to give them something they can put in a headline to get someone to click. Asking for a tuition refund does that. It's not about the money, it's about making the story news worthy and thereby making the issue one the administration actually needs to handle instead of ignore.

If anyone thinks this way of handling problems is specific to universities, by the way, I hope they enjoy their eventual interactions with management and attempting to get actual changes made (or are on the receiving end of changes being made) once they become employed.

1kneerk,mskiy7y,"I think it's appropriate to make a distinction between pre-training, fine-tuning, and RLHF here. Yes, LLMs are first trained as next-token predictors in pre-training. This is where they get their initial weights and word vectors. They're then trained for task-specific behavior (generating useful responses to human queries) in fine-tuning. And this is followed by reinforcement learning through human feedback where prospective responses are graded by human feedback so the model can learn to prefer generating responses that humans judge as more preferable.



So, while it's true that models like chatgpt are trained to predict the most-likely next word, that's only the first step in training. They're further trained after that point to produce responses that align with desired output guidelines and trained even more after that to produce responses that align with preferences from human feedback.


And as you might expect, part of this fine-tuning includes scoring responses more highly of they're factually accurate.",1747367875.0,2,2025-05-16 03:57:55

The best part about it is that I get to break my ADHD tendencies and have something to work with without staring at a screen blankly wondering where I should start.

>>Have you SEEN Trump? In what world does he have 4.8% body fat?

>Exactly — that’s the whole point. The 4.8% body fat claim sounds ridiculous to anyone with eyes and a basic understanding of physiology.

>To put it into perspective:
	
•	4.8% body fat is elite bodybuilder territory — like, shredded-on-stage competition shape.
	
•	Most professional athletes sit around 8–12% in peak condition.
	
•	For context:
	
•	Bruce Lee was ~6%
	
•	Cristiano Ronaldo is ~7–8%
	
•	Trump? Visibly not in that category.

>So when those numbers were reported (likely in an official statement during a past medical checkup), it raised eyebrows because it defies basic biological norms. He doesn’t appear remotely close to that level of conditioning.

>That’s why ChatGPT — or any medical AI or calculator — flagged it. Not because of who he is, but because it’s like someone saying a golden retriever is 2 pounds and 8 feet tall. It just doesn’t compute.

did Donald Trump's health check just published say he has 4.8% body fat

No, Donald Trump's recently published health check did not state that he has 4.8% body fat. The official medical report released by the White House lists his height as 6 feet 3 inches (75 inches) and his weight as 224 pounds, giving him a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which is classified as ""overweight""—not an extremely low body fat percentage[6][9][10]. 

The 4.8% body fat figure appears to be a joke or exaggeration circulating on social media, not an official statement from his physician or the White House[11]. The actual health report does not mention a specific body fat percentage, and reputable news sources confirm only the BMI and general health details, not an unusually low body fat measurement[1][5][6].

Not one of them gets to ""harvest information about you"". The ads ecosystem on the internet *is* a pile of shit, yes, but there's *so much* misunderstood about it - especially by the people most vocal about how much they hate it.

The key thing to realise, to understand what's actually going on under the hood here, is that *this* line, which sounds like an admission, was *exactly* as fabricated as the initial fake quotes, and the further set of fake quotes. It's still a lie.

The only difference between this line and those is that this fabrication *happened* to align with reality (as in, *you* know that the five initial quotes were faked). It itself does not actually ""know"" that the five initial quotes were fake, and this ""Sorry, no"" line of it is not an admission that it ""knows"" that, either. It's just what the algorithm underneath it has determined is the most likely answer it ""should"" give when questioned in the way you questioned it, after having the prior exchange you had.

None of it's based on ""truth"" because there's no concept of ""truth"" involved at any part of the LLM's training routines. Every bit of output is *always* a guess/lie, it's just that sometimes the guesses/lies happen to align with reality, purely by chance.

I’m sure there’s more. But, let’s just use Idiocracy as our measuring stick and see how far along we are. I’m going to go and ask ChatGPT for a list of all the stupid shit that the world did in the movie. BRB…

Edit: ok I’m back… my comments after the second hyphen in each bullet. Tl;dr: we’re about halfway there!

Society & Intelligence

Intelligence has dramatically declined – smart people stopped having kids while the less intelligent reproduced unchecked. - ok, this has been happening for a little while, but might be a holdover from his first term. We’re definitely heading in that direction. 

Anti-intellectualism is rampant – being smart or using big words is seen as weird or suspicious. - Check.

People speak in a mash of grunts, slang, and profanity – the English language has devolved into something barely coherent. - Nope, we have at least one thing we can devolve to!

 Healthcare & Government

Hospitals use touchscreen kiosks with pictures to diagnose problems – like choosing a sad face for ""I hurt."" - I swear this is actually a thing now. Not sure.

Doctors are clueless and unqualified – Joe gets a medical exam from a guy who barely knows what a stethoscope is. - I don’t think this is normal. Is it?

The President is a former pro wrestler/reality TV star – President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. - Sigh. Yeah. 
Courtrooms are like game shows – complete with jeering crowds and incompetent judges. - Regardless of how you feel about any particular judge, it’s the same now as it was in the 80s. 

Prisoners are released when confused – Joe accidentally escapes prison by just asking where to go. - I think we’re actually doing the reverse of this. 

 Food & Drink

People drink ""Brawndo"" instead of water – an energy drink used for hydration, crop irrigation, and even as a medical fluid. - Just give it time.

Water is only used in toilets – because “plants crave electrolytes,” not water. - Nope. 

Fast food and junk food dominate all diets – Carl’s Jr. commercials insult you for not eating their food. - All diets? No, but close enough.

Giant-sized everything – sodas, meals, and snacks are comically enormous. - Same as above.

 Entertainment & Media

TV shows are dumbed down to pure slapstick – e.g., “Ow! My Balls!” is the top-rated show. - Check. 

Advertisements are constant and hypersexualized – everything is sponsored, often crudely. - Check. 

Porn and violence are mainstream – background screens show adult content or fights constantly. - Almost check, depending on the state you live in and if you use a VPN.  

 Economy & Infrastructure

Everything is corporatized – even government buildings and welfare are sponsored by brands like Carl's Jr., Brawndo, and Costco. - Goya, anyone?

Costco is a literal city – complete with an education department and a wedding chapel. - I wish.

Machines constantly malfunction – society runs on broken tech no one understands. - Lol, I’m sure some old COBOL guys can chime in here and tell us about the good old days when everything was always broken, too.

Jobs are assigned based on random aptitude tests – which are more like personality quizzes. - Yep. 

 Agriculture & Environment

Crops are dying because they're irrigated with Brawndo – and nobody knows why that's bad. - Given the FDA and USDA statuses, I think we’re headed that way real soon.

1lg7j2y,myumoyc,"How many times is this going to be posted? Here is a comment from an actual neuroscientist the last time this was posted calling out how bad this study was and why peer reviewing is so important which this study did not do:

> I'm a neuroscientist. This study is silly. It suffers from several methodological and interpretive limitations. The small sample size - especially the drop to only 18 participants in the critical crossover session - is a serious problem for about statistical power and the reliability of EEG findings.The design lacks counterbalancing, making it impossible to rule out order effects. Constructs like ""cognitive engagement"" and ""essay ownership"" are vaguely defined and weakly operationalized, with overreliance on reverse inference from EEG patterns. Essay quality metrics are opaque, and the tool use conditions differ not just in assistance level but in cognitive demands, making between-group comparisons difficult to interpret. Finally sweeping claims about cognitive decline due to LLM use are premature given the absence of long-term outcome measures.

>Shoulda gone through peer review. This is as embarrassing as the time Iacoboni et al published their silly and misguided NYT article (https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/opinion/11freedman.html; response by over a dozen neuroscientists: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/opinion/lweb14brain.html).

>Oh my god and the N=18 condition is actually two conditions, so it's actually N=9. Lmao this study is garbage, literal trash.

They seemed to hang their hat on the inability to recall what they ""wrote"". This is pretty well known already from anybody that uses it for coding. It's not a great idea to just copy and paste code between the LLM and the IDE because you're not processing or undersatnding it. If people are copy and pasting without taking the time to unpack and understand the code -- that's user error, not the LLM's fault.

It's also unclear if ""lower EEG activity"" is inherently a bad thing. It just indicates that they didn't need to think as hard.

This is obvious to anyone whose transitioned from not using LLMs to using them. Obviously it's not as mentally intensive as hand-writing anything... that's kind of the entire point of them. 

Now, to claim that using LLMs leads to permanent, pervasive cognitive decline is a *bit* of a witch hunt without being outright false.

>For the lay person, it is simply a faster google search. But this is typically not even a good thing. With google search, one needs to go on a few websites until they get their answer/learn about a topic. This develops research and critical thinking skills. But if you rely on AI to do this for you, you might save a bit of time, but at the expense of developing these skills. Just like how GPS and google maps significantly reduced our skill of remembering directions, AI will do the same thing in terms of knowledge overall. Not knowing directions is a small skill to use, but losing our critical thinking ability and organic knowledge as a whole is a much bigger deal. Of course, there will be some people who will use chatGPT properly and will use it to actually aid in attaining their organic knowledge, but very few will be like this.

1lg7j2y,myxnr3q,"This MIT “study” by Nataliya Kosmyna claiming that ChatGPT is causing cognitive decline. Well, let’s pull back the curtain, I fucking hope you read this Nataliya.

This wasn’t some ironclad neurological revelation. It was:
A tiny sample size (54 people),  a radio shack EEG measuring surface brain activity, not actual deep cognition, and strong subjective evaluation of creativity.

And worst of all, a tone of superiority that reeks of intellectual gatekeeping.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:
Kosmyna isn’t really warning you about ChatGPT.
She’s warning you about what happens when normal people no longer need elite intermediaries to think clearly.

ChatGPT doesn’t replace thinking. It amplifies it. For people like me, it’s the tool that helps organize thoughts, sharpen ideas, and engage with complexity in real time. In other words, it provides access to the kind of cognitive leverage that used to require a team of research assistants, editors, or consultants. That used to be an elite privilege.

So let’s call this what it is:
Not a cautionary tale.
But an elitist backlash against democratized intelligence.

I challenge Kosmyna directly:
If your concern is real thinking, let’s have a real debate. But don’t mask your fear of lost academic gatekeeping behind sensational headlines. Some of us don’t want to outsource our minds. We just finally have a tool that gives us a fair shot at using them fully.

GPT isn’t a crutch. It’s a scaffold.

It was not uncommon for people to sit around at the end of the day and recite works to one another for entertainment. My grandparents describe their parents doing this as recently as the early 1900s.

Nowadays people don’t memorize things like that because there hasn’t been a need to for over a century. Media is stored on hard drives, and can be accessed on demand. Which is great, but the reality is that the skill of memorization is one that has gone dormant in human society.

Were stakes low?
I'm going to assume no grades or real-world outcome. Just the inertia of being part of a study and wanting it over with.

Were they fatigued?
Four months of writing exercises that had no real stakes sounds mind-numbing. So i'd say this is more motivation decay than cognitive decline.

- The decline mentioned was concluded from the final session, where previous LLM users were required to hand write an essay and performed much worse (in scoring) compared to the group who hand wrote 3 essays and then switched to LLM assisted. The discussion draws the conclusion that LLM assisted learning results in reduced engagement and poorer retention and performance

3 groups were asked to write an essay on a list of predetermined philosophical topics. There were 3 different sessions spread over a few months, with a new topic each time.
Group 1: ChatGPT allowed
Group 2: google but no LLM
Group 3: Brain Only

Group 1 wrote long essays and injtially were editing their texts, but by the third session were just copy-pasting directly. 
Group 2 wrote medium essays and found other people's experiences to help inform their writing.
Group 3 wrote shorter essays that were based on personal stories or ideas that the participants held.

When asked about their essays, group 2 and 3 could easily quote exact lines and ideas from theirs. Group 1 had statistically significantly worse recall, in the final session, none of the participants could quote their essay.

When asked a few weeks later if they remembered any of the things they were asked to write about, group 3 remembered the most, followed by 2, then group 1 where some didn't even recognise the question they replied to.

In September 2022 (about two months before the first version of ChatGPT came out), my immune system attacked the protein sheath around the neurons in my brain (a condition called autoimmune disseminated encephalomyelitis, not entirely dissimilar from multiple sclerosis—one of my neurologists specializes in MS).  This caused severe cognitive dysfunction, necessitating that I (in essence, if not in fact) relearn to operate my brain.  

One of the top tools for this critical project was Nintendo's **Brain Age** series of games (and similar games:  the ironically-named (considering that what ADEM is is inflammation of the protein sheath around the neurons in my brain—in other words, part of the brain being bigger than usual) **Big Brain Academy**, **Flash Focus** (I was functionally blind for a period), **Thinkie**).  They're not *officially* cleared by the FDA (or related authorization boards) as therapeutic tools, but the exercises are practically (if not actually) identical to exercises given to me by medical practitioners directly administering treatment to me, and were encouraged by the same medical practitioners.

1lg7j2y,myvvryb,"I think if you read the first few pages of the study your questions would expand a bit

So there weren't two groups there were three. LLM's, brain only, and google assisted. And 4 sessions

Ah but there's a twist where the meat of these articles(that have for some reason have been posted multiple times here now) get their data from. See the 4th session has the brain only switch to LLM, and the LLM to brain only. The brain scans of which are the basis of their statements that it degrades with use.

If anyone is like me the question is going to be what happened to the google folk. Because the answer is they didn't do a 4th testing.

To me that was doubly weird because that represents something closer to the baseline user. As in they generally use tools to assist in writing not just brute force. 

In fact while the brain activity might say that the brain only was more active, they actually scored the lowest on their papers output. So what's that supposed to say? Either people get brain rot or high scores? Having that other group in the switch to LLM for the 4th measurement would have done a lot to give better perspective

And most of the rest was studies saying what most people would say is probably going to be true. LLM users wouldn't recall their work as well, google better, and brain only best. People using LLM's tend to start forming their wording to start matching patterns that LLM's use, which is also not all that unusual, you read/write in a certain style and you tend to adopt it, although it could also say they were picking up a lot more then the study gave credit for too even if it wasn't verbatim(hard to say they just cut and paste if their actual writing style changed)

But like most papers like this we'll never hear about it again once the next shiny thing comes along, and even if it fails peer review we'll never actually know. We're kind of weird like that.

Edit: I just remember the doom and gloom of ""the internet"" on people's ability to learn(not social media, just the net). We weren't even allowed to cite it in school. So ya, resting entirely on something that spits out information is going to make to softer in your thinking.

The small sample size - especially the drop to only 18 participants in the critical crossover session - is a serious problem for about statistical power and the reliability of EEG findings.The design lacks counterbalancing, making it impossible to rule out order effects. Constructs like ""cognitive engagement"" and ""essay ownership"" are vaguely defined and weakly operationalized, with overreliance on reverse inference from EEG patterns. Essay quality metrics are opaque, and the tool use conditions differ not just in assistance level but in cognitive demands, making between-group comparisons difficult to interpret. Finally sweeping claims about cognitive decline due to LLM use are premature given the absence of long-term outcome measures.

* The people responsible for it have no ethical basis for anything they do. LLMs are a warehouse of stolen data and information, fed into a black box with no morals or context for what it means to be human, and then allowed to produce everything from invasion plans to legal cases.

* Humans are becoming more and more isolated from each other, more paranoid, and more distrustful, while the machine becomes more useful, reliable, safer, and more trusted. Children are learning to use ChatGPT instead of being able to form their own opinions, write their own essays, or attempt to convince or persuade anyone else.

I can’t find my history to repeat that, but just asked a very specific gift tax question in copilot and was very impressed with the accurate answer, including citations of primary sources.

1jqt250,ml9wm2d,"I had GPT fact check the stats and it said:

“1. Tariffs vs. Trade Barriers vs. Currency Manipulation

These are distinct concepts often conflated for political impact:

a. Tariffs
	•	These are actual import taxes—easy to measure.
	•	For example, China’s average applied tariff rate is around 7.5–10%, not 67%.
	•	Vietnam’s average is around 10–15%, depending on the sector.
	•	The WTO tracks these in public databases.

b. Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs)
	•	Includes things like:
	•	Lengthy customs clearance
	•	Local content requirements
	•	Subsidies to domestic industries
	•	Licensing restrictions
	•	Hard to quantify precisely and often subject to interpretation.
	•	Some industries (like agriculture or tech) are more heavily protected than others.

c. Currency Manipulation
	•	Refers to a country artificially devaluing its currency to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
	•	It’s extremely difficult to assign a percentage value to this—there’s no agreed-upon formula to say, “Vietnam manipulates its currency by 30%, so add that to its tariff rate.”

⸻

2. Problems with the Numbers in the Chart
	•	These percentages appear to be arbitrary aggregations that lack citation or international acceptance.
	•	The chart inflates the impact by blending real tariffs with subjective NTBs and currency practices.
	•	The WTO, IMF, and World Bank do not publish such figures in this form.

For instance:
	•	Cambodia: 97% tariff? Cambodia has preferential trade access under GSP with the U.S. and EU and very low actual tariffs.
	•	Vietnam: 90%? This is wildly overstated. USTR reports point to non-tariff barriers, but nothing near this.
	•	Madagascar: 93%? That’s not supported by any public data.
	•	U.K., Australia, Brazil: 10%? All three countries have free trade or low-tariff relationships with the U.S.

⸻

3. What’s Likely Going On

This appears to be part of a political narrative intended to:
	•	Justify high retaliatory tariffs by making foreign trade policies look outrageously unfair.
	•	Manufacture consent for trade wars and economic nationalism by inflating foreign protectionism.
	•	Collapse complex economic dynamics into an easy-to-digest “they’re cheating, we’re fair” chart.

There’s a strategic rhetorical move happening here—what Noam Chomsky might call “manufactured outrage” to mobilize domestic support.

⸻

4. What You Can Trust
	•	WTO’s World Tariff Profiles: Offers real average applied MFN tariffs.
	•	USTR’s National Trade Estimate Report: Identifies specific non-tariff barriers by country.
	•	IMF & Treasury Reports: Monitor currency practices, including manipulation claims.”",1743717187.0,9,2025-04-03 21:53:07

Bush, a “voodoo economics” boondoggle that will trigger skyrocketing price increases on practically every major product we purchase and consume.

The self-destructive idiocy of heavy tariffs helped cause the Great Depression and is *the worst* possible reaction to lingering high prices.

The economically illiterate Trump during early days of his train wreck of a first term suggested fulfilling his nonsensical campaign promise to pay off the national debt by “run[ning] the presses”— the U.S. Treasury Department simply printing an extra $20.2 trillion in U.S. dollars. By the end of Trump’s term, based on the amount of additional debt his policies added, the preposterous print run would’ve totaled *$29 trillion.*

Trump’s trade brain trust is led by Peter Navarro, who served a similar role during Trump’s first administration and holds views considered highly fringe by mainstream economists. 

Navarro, who spent 4 months in federal prison last year for defying congressional subpoenas, also was heavily involved in Trump’s foiled attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election. 

Navarro not surprisingly was also a contributor to Project 2025, the far right roadmap to bestow gargantuan tax breaks on the super-rich while screwing over the rest of us by gutting the federal government’s workforce, oversight of environmental and public  health/safety and critically important safety net programs for the most vulnerable among us.

In the second hour of attempted mockery and braindead takes, interruptions, and yelling, Sam brought this ""uninhabited"" anecdote up.  

Mind you, earlier they had googled shit like 3 different times when Sam asked them to. 
 Sam was pretty much right every time.

Anyways, he was a bit ineloquent probably misremembering slightly and they kept trying to absolutely CLOWN on him for trump supposedly tariffing uninhabited places.  They showed him ZERO grace and went full alpha and tried to bully him out of it.

Rather than take 10 seconds to google it, they instead brought it up at least twice more as ""well you thought trump imposed tariffs on uninhabited places.  India is on the list, guess its uninhabited.""  Just real ripe, rank nonsense.

>the act raised tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods in an effort to shield American industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression, which had started in October 1929.
>
>At first, the tariff seemed to be a success... However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff became apparent.
>
>U.S. imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. US gross national product fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933... Overall, world trade decreased by some 66% between 1929 and 1934.
>
>Unemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot–Hawley Act was passed but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and to 25% in 1932–1933. There is some contention about whether this can necessarily be attributed to the tariff... However, the tariff worsened the crisis by shrinking global trade, hurting farmers, and reducing employment in export-dependent industries. Had it not passed, the Depression still would have occurred, but perhaps with less severity.

1lkl0kj,mzuucfp,"My company just rolled out Copilot licences for us, given we're already heavily using Microsoft products and are migrating to GitHub it made sense. From what I could see online they both use OpenAI GPT models, although likely some slightly different versions. I can't say I've tested them extensively enough to give a true verdict, but the results seem pretty similar, both have been better than I expected at some relatively niche code, both have made dumb mistakes sometimes, but are easily enough identified.

Copilot mostly shines through the VS Code integration though, for my work as a developer (I've not used it in any other context through Office or whatever other integrations they have). Having the context of your code base without having to upload it manually, and having the auto completion within the editor is pretty powerful. Definitely also has the possibility to give you some incorrect code if you're not paying attention too, but for boilerplate stuff it can save a lot of time.

I'm no Microsoft fan, I don't really use any of their products by choice. If I'm working on a personal project at home or just asking an AI some questions, yeah I'd probably just jump to ChatGPT because of familiarity. But having it packaged within the editor I'm already using makes it far more appealing to use than copy/pasting stuff between my editor and a website. Not to mention that company compliance rules will usually say you definitely shouldn't be uploading your companies code to any third party that you don't have a contract with, but if your code is already in GitHub that's an easier agreement to make.

In a way it's kind of the usual Microsoft playbook with the old ""embrace, extend, extinguish"" - I don't know how much of their own work they're even doing with CoPilot if they're just using OpenAI's models, but CoPilot extends and packages it in a more convenient way for coders. And then it's the old vendor lockin, either not having a choice, or it at least being the easier choice, to use the Microsoft product when a company is already heavily invested with their suite. So I'm kind of surprised they're not having more success with this, when it's going to be the easy choice for a lot of companies, and a more convenient integration for a lot of developers.",1750932172.0,1,2025-06-26 10:02:52

They had geofences you could trigger for things so I could get notified to do something when I got to places, Google got this later but I will say that every android phone I've had fails to trigger at locations 99% of the time. I know it's GAsst being garbage though, because fences set in say, Google Keep notes, trigger perfectly. How Google allows this crap to stay this way is beyond me.

Anyway though, couple features that made the MS one better: I could say something like ""The next time I get to..."" so if I was at that place already, it wouldn't trigger until I left once and came back, which was really great for reminding myself to do something when I got home at an unknown time of when it'd be.

Also back on the location based triggers: Sometimes you'd give things an address whether it's Microsoft's or Google or whoever's services, and not have it work because say, the place you're going is a bit far back off of the main road or whatever. You could ask Cortana ""Where am I?"" at the spot you had issues at, and could then plugin whatever it gave you to that trigger to make it actually frickin' work next time.

This also might have just been a basic WP8 feature and not Cortana too, but still blows me the hell away that I've seen literally no Android developers (not sure on apple) do this with their stock software.

So, not only will it tell you the last location you yourself connected to the device, if someone else with an iphone has walked past it recently it will have communicated with that iphone and that phone will have communicated that back to the server and to you to let you know that it's still there or if it's been moved since you left. It also notifies you if you're away from home and a device of yours leaves the range of bluetooth from your phone. That way if you, for example, leave your airpods on a bus, it'll ping you the second they're out of range to let you know that you left them somewhere. It does this even if they're not actively paired to your phone which is nice.

I know the todo list app I was using at the time was using that Cortana API, it wasn't Microsoft (ironically they own it now, it was Wunderlist, but they bought the company and had them make Microsoft Todo, turns out Wunderlist was built on amazon web services and it was very annoying to just slide it over to Azure) but it used it, was very nice.

I too joked about Windows Phone like many others at one point until I did ironically have one and I ended up liking it a lot more than I expected. It's not as customizable as Android, but it's not as tied down as Apple, either. I also really liked that you could just run apps off the card just like as if you had attached a disk drive to a PC with programs on it and just ran them, shocking!

Android keeps avoiding even using SD cards now, but apps on SD have always been sloppy on android, you could like, install an APK but at least part of the app would be on the device itself, never just contained on the disk entirely like it could be on desktop Windows like this did. I could have had multiple SD cards full of apps and just swapped them as needed without having to ""install"" things constantly and waste internal storage to do it. Now they don't even like you doing anything with apps on SD if you don't format it in a weird way that only lets it ever work on that specific device it's in. 

They also had a way to override notification sounds per app too, waaaaay before Android did. Some custom android builds like Samsung's, could sometimes do this, earlier but the base OS couldn't do this for at least 5+ years after MS did it. Like real talk, what's the point of some of these notification sounds if every single one sounds the same and you don't know what they are? lol.

They also focused on putting a lot of major UI widgets at the bottom of the screen. At the time I thought this was weird, until I realized it was designed so you could hold your phone and control most things with one hand with only a thumb that couldn't reach the top of the screen, the ergonomics were well thought out. Google only realized this and started pushing for it like 8 years later or something.

1lkl0kj,mzuruqr,"I joined a call recently where the other side was using AI for note taking and I will say reading the output was mildly infuriating. It couldn't understand if someone said something and 5 minutes later someone else clarified a point that changed the original takeaway. For example someone saying ""X team we need Y by next week"" and then 5 minutes later someone says ""Hey isn't Z needed before Y can be started? I think we should talk to the team that does Z first so maybe let's bench Y for now"" 

the AI notes will say something like:

Action items
- X does Y by next week 
- More stuff
- Someone communicate with team that does Z and we bench Y for now

So you really can't treat it like a list of actual action items. Someone reading these notes on team X would probably stop at the first one and say damn guess i'll get started on Y since it's the only action item I'm mentioned in and if it's in the list it means I gotta do it by next week. 

And when you amplify it over a full hour it turns into like 40 lines of nonsense where you have to actively go through it and figure out which ones are real and which ones are just the same point written down 10 different times in different ways because it took some discussion to land at a conclusion but the AI didn't actually know that.",1750930810.0,18,2025-06-26 09:40:10
